# NOTES TO READER
# ============================================================
# The following code was used by the R. Jones Lab to process and 
# analyze publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data. 
#
# Data Source:
#   FASTQ files were not generated in-house by the R. Jones Lab.
#   They were mined from the following publication:
#   DOI: 10.1002/path.6259
#   "Cellular and molecular characteristics of stromal Lkb1 deficiency-
#   induced gastrointestinal polyposis based on single-cell RNA sequencing"
#
# Purpose:
#   - This code reflects the steps we used to parse and analyze data 
#     for Shelby's LKB1 Project (started 16DEC24).
#   - To the best of our knowledge, analyses were carried out in a manner 
#     consistent with the original authors.
#   - Some analyses shown here were used in the manuscript; other 
#     exploratory code sections were not.
#
# Code Disclaimer:
#   - This is working analysis code, not a polished software package.
#   - Some sections may appear redundant or exploratory; this was part 
#     of the iterative analysis process.
#   - We did not attempt to streamline or extensively clean the script 
#     beyond what was necessary for reproducibility.
#
# Contact:
#   - For questions about this analysis, please contact:
#       Brandon Oswald (brandon.oswald@vai.org)
#       or the senior author Rusty Jones.
#
# Thank you for your understanding.

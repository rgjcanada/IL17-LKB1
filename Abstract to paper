Mutations in the tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) promote the development of gastrointestinal (GI) polyps of unknown etiology. 
Here, we identify IL-17 as a novel driver of LKB1-dependent polyp growth. GI tumors from mice bearing heterozygous mutations in Stk11 
(which encodes LKB1) display signatures of pathogenic IL-17–producing CD4+ T helper 17 (TH17) cells. LKB1 constrains T cell inflammatory 
potential, as Stk11/LKB1 haploinsufficiency promotes T cell differentiation toward pathogenic IL-17–producing T cell lineages 
(CD4+ TH17 and CD8+ Tc17) in vitro and following intestinal infection. Mechanistically, aberrant CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 
(CRTC2)–dependent signaling drives pathogenic TH17 cell programs downstream of LKB1 haploinsufficiency. Targeting this circuit via CRTC2 deletion 
or IL-17 blockade antagonizes GI polyp growth in mouse models of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. These findings establish LKB1 as a gatekeeper of inflammatory 
type 3 (IL-17–dependent) T cell responses and identify a CRTC2–IL-17 signaling axis that can be targeted therapeutically to block the growth of LKB1 
mutant GI tumors.
